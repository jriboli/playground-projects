        Protecting the privacy of our customers is important to Frontier. This
        privacy policy is designed to inform you about how we collect, use,
        share, and protect the information of customers of our consumer and
        residential services, namely our high-speed Internet, home phone,
        multichannel video, Wi-Fi Hot Spot, and Frontier Secure services. It
        also governs the information we collect when you visit our website, and
        describes certain choices we provide to our customers regarding the use
        of their information. This policy does not govern the services we offer
        to businesses, including Frontier Business Edge. Please note that
        separate privacy policies may apply to the services of other providers
        that you purchase from us. We encourage you to review the privacy
        policies and practices of such other providers.
      </p>
      <span class="fw-block"
        >What Information We Collect and How We Collect It</span
      >
      <p>
        We collect certain information when you use our products, services, and
        websites, as well as when you communicate with us. Information You
        Provide to Us. We collect information you provide to us, such as your
        name and contact information, driver’s license number, Social Security
        Number, and payment information. We also may maintain research records
        containing information obtained through voluntary subscriber interviews
        or surveys. Information Related to Your Use of Our Services. We also
        collect information about how you use our products and services. This
        information may include call records, the websites you visit,
        information about the devices you use in connection with our services,
        your bandwidth usage, and your TV and other video viewership, including
        movie rental and purchase data. Information Collected When You Use Our
        Websites and Mobile Apps. We collect certain information when you visit
        a Frontier website or use a Frontier mobile app, including information
        about your operating system and browser, IP address and device
        identification numbers, and web addresses of the websites you come from
        and go to next. When You Use the Frontier Android App. With your
        permission, we may access information from your device, such as your
        general location, contact lists, SMS messages, Call logs, photo and
        video library, documents, music. This information is only accessed if
        you grant us access to it, and if it’s required for the service to
        operate, or required for specific features of the service to operate.
        For example, we cannot backup or restore your content like contacts, SMS
        messages, photos and videos, documents, music on your behalf if you do
        not grant us the required permissions. Frontier, or third-party analytic
        companies acting on Frontier’s behalf, also may use cookies, web
        beacons, and other tracking mechanisms to collect information while you
        visit our websites. A cookie is a small data file placed in your
        browser. Web beacons are small, clear graphic images. Mechanisms such as
        these allow for the collection of information about your interactions
        with our websites. We also may receive demographic information about
        you, or information regarding your interests, from third-party analytics
        companies that use cookies and other tracking mechanisms. Frontier also
        allows third-party advertising companies to display ads when you visit
        our websites. These companies may use information about your visits to
        our and other websites—but not your name, address, email address, or
        telephone number—to provide advertisements about goods and services of
        interest to you. As described below, you have choices available to you
        regarding the use of your information for advertising. In addition, some
        browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” mechanisms. Most of these
        mechanisms, when turned on, send a signal to the website or online
        service indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked online.
        However, because the providers of “Do Not Track” and similar signals do
        not yet operate according to common, industry-accepted standards, we
        currently do not respond to those signals. For more information about Do
        Not Track mechanisms, see http://allaboutdnt.com. Information from Third
        Parties. At times, we receive information about our customers from third
        parties, such as credit information from credit reporting agencies, when
        you purchase products or apply for service. We also may receive
        marketing and other information, including but not limited to
        demographic information, about you from third parties. If you rent your
        residence, we may have a record of whether the landlord’s permission was
        required to install our facilities, as well as the landlord’s name and
        contact information. In addition, we may obtain information from other
        service providers when you purchase certain services from us, such as
        our DISH TV Package or the eero home Wi-Fi system. If you use social
        media credentials to login or interact with a Frontier website, mobile
        app, or Frontier’s social media pages, we may collect information about
        your social media profile. You can control the data we receive in this
        manner through the controls available in your social media account
        settings. When You Contact Us. When you contact us or we contact you, we
        may monitor or record the communication, and keep records of and about
        the communication, so that we can provide better service. We will inform
        you during such a call that the call might be monitored or recorded.
      </p>
      <span class="fw-block"
        >How We Use and Share the Information We Collect</span
      >
      <p>
        We use the information we collect about customers to provide, manage,
        and improve the services we offer; bill and collect for our services; to
        better understand our customers and market our services, as well as to
        deliver relevant advertising; respond to customer questions and
        concerns; and to manage, repair, and protect our network. We or third
        parties acting on our behalf use the information collected from cookies
        and other tracking mechanisms to customize your experience and gather
        information about how you navigate our website. For example, cookies and
        other tracking mechanisms allow us to remember you when you visit our
        websites, deliver relevant advertising to you, market our services on
        our websites and on third-party websites, and keep track of your online
        ordering and account information. We may share personal information with
        third-party agents and vendors that perform services on our behalf as
        necessary for them to perform these services. Frontier requires such
        agents and vendors to use this information only as we direct, and to
        protect it consistent with this policy. In addition, we may share
        information with other providers when you purchase their services from
        us, such as our DISH TV Package or the eero home Wi-Fi system. We also
        may share your information (1) with your permission or at your
        direction, (2) as required by law, including in response to a
        duly-served subpoena or other government request for information, (3) to
        investigate or defend against third-party claims or allegations, (4) to
        protect our rights, property, and personal safety, or that of our
        customers or others, or (5) as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of
        company assets or transition of service to another provider. We do not
        otherwise share your personal information. We may, however, share
        anonymous or aggregate information with third parties, including to
        improve how we provide service to existing and potential customers.
      </p>
      <span class="fw-block"
        >How You Can Limit the Sharing and Use of Your Information</span
      >
      <p>
        We provide you several choices regarding how we use and share your
        information. Customer Proprietary Network Information. You may limit our
        use and sharing of a certain type of customer information, known as
        Customer Proprietary Network Information, or “CPNI.” CPNI is information
        that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical
        configuration, location, amount of use, and related billing information
        of your telecommunications services. Protecting the confidentiality of
        your CPNI is your right and our duty under federal law. You can limit
        the use and sharing of your CPNI for marketing services other than the
        ones we currently provide to you by calling us at 1.877.213.1556 or
        visiting https://frontier.com/cpni. Any restriction of our use of your
        CPNI will stay in effect until you notify us otherwise. If you choose to
        restrict access to your CPNI, your service will not be affected, and you
        will continue to receive the same high-quality services from us. Please
        note that restricting our use of your CPNI will not eliminate all of our
        marketing contacts with you, as you may still receive marketing contacts
        that are not based on your restricted CPNI. Frontier takes the privacy
        of customer information seriously and appreciates the opportunity to
        provide high quality communications services to you. Other choices
        regarding marketing contacts are described below.
      </p>
      <span class="fw-block"
        >We do not disclose CPNI to third parties, other than affiliated
        companies or their agents, without your consent, except as required or
        allowed by law.</span
      >
      <p>
        Information Used for Online Advertising. If you would like more
        information about interest-based advertising, or about ways in which you
        can prevent companies from using this information, you can visit
        http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1. In addition, you can manage
        cookies by using features and functions available on most Internet
        browsers, for example by deleting or disabling cookies. Please note that
        disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our
        websites and other websites. Do Not Call. Federal “Do Not Call” allow
        you to place your phone number on the National Do Not Call List to
        prevent telemarketing calls to your phone number. Certain states have
        similar laws and maintain their own lists. Frontier also maintains an
        internal Do Not Call List. You may view our Do Not Call Policy in its
        entirety. Marketing E-Mails. To opt out of receiving marketing emails
        from Frontier, please email us at privacy@ftr.com.
      </p>
      <span class="fw-block">How We Protect Your Information</span>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to
        protect against unauthorized access to, use of, or disclosure of the
        personal information we collect and store. No program is 100% secure,
        however. As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will prevent every
        unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose personal information.
        Personally identifiable and other sensitive records are retained only as
        long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax, or legal
        purposes.
      </p>
      <span class="fw-block">Changes to This Privacy Policy</span>
      <p>
        We may make changes to this policy from time to time and encourage you
        to periodically review this policy for any such changes. We will notify
        you of any material changes by posting a notice on our website home page
        and the privacy policy page 30 days before any change takes effect.
      </p>
      <span class="fw-block">Contact Us</span>
      <p>
        If you have questions or concerns related to our privacy policy or
        information practices, email us at privacy@FTR.com or contact us at
        Frontier Communications, P.O.Box 5165, Tampa, FL 33675.
