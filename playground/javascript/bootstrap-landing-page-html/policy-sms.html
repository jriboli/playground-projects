        1. When you opt-in to receive specific types of operational, billing or
        marketing messages from Frontier (each type a “Program”), you agree to
        these SMS Terms and Conditions and to Frontier’s Privacy Policy and
        Terms of Use. 2. We will send you a message to confirm your signup to a
        Program. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies.
        Text "HELP" for help. Text "STOP" to cancel. 3. Message frequency will
        vary according to how you interact with the Program. You expressly agree
        that Frontier and its representatives can use automatic telephone
        dialing systems or other technology to Program content and
        administrative messages to the telephone number you use to enroll even
        if it is listed on federal, state, provincial or other "Do Not Call"
        lists. If you change your telephone number, you agree to opt-out of the
        Program prior to changing your mobile number. 4. You can cancel
        receiving messages about a Program any time. Just text "STOP". After you
        send the message "STOP" to us, we will send you a reply message to
        confirm that you have been unsubscribed to the Program. If you want to
        receive messages regarding the Program again, reply “START”. 5. If at
        any time you need help, just text "HELP". We will direct you to
