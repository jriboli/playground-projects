Mountain Dew Code Red is a cherry-flavored soft drink produced and manufactured by PepsiCo. It is a variation of the original Mountain Dew flavor but has a distinct red color and a pronounced cherry taste. Originally introduced in 2001, Code Red was marketed as a bold alternative to traditional citrus flavors of soda. Over the years, it has gained a cult following and is known for its vibrant packaging and high caffeine content compared to regular Mountain Dew. The drink has also been featured in various promotions, including tie-ins with video games and extreme sports events.
