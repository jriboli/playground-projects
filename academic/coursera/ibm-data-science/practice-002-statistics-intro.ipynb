    "- `Sample`: is a subset of the population, selected to represent the whole\n",
    "    - notation :: Sample statistics are represented by <b>Latin letters</b> (e.g., 𝑥̄ for mean, s for standard deviation)\n",
    "- `Discrete` : data consists of values that can be counted and are typically whole numbers (integers). There are no in-between values. (e.g. Number of cats)\n",
    "- `Continuous` : consists of values that can be measured and take any value within a range, including fractions and decimals. (e.g. distance between A -> B)\n",
