    "A company manufactures electronic chips, and 5% of them are defective. If a quality control inspector randomly selects 200 chips, answer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the expected number of defective chips in the sample?\n",
    "What is the standard error (variation in the number of defective chips from sample to sample)?\n",

    "### Problem 2: Z-Score & Probability\n",
    "The heights of adult males in a certain country follow a normal distribution with:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean = 175 cm\n",
    "Standard deviation = 8 cm\n",
    "A random man is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the Z-score for a man who is 185 cm tall?\n",
    "Using the Z-table, what percentage of men are shorter than 185 cm?\n",

    "A basketball player makes 75% of free throws. If they take 400 shots, estimate the probability that they will:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make 320 or more shots using the normal approximation to the binomial.\n",
    "Interpret the resultâ€”does making 320+ shots seem like a rare event?"
